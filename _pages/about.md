I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Networking and Communication at [the University of Science and Technology, The University of Danang](https://dut.udn.vn/) in Vietnam. I received [my Ph.D.](https://www.sut.ru/bonchnews/science/4767-pozdravlyaem-s-zaschitoy-dissertacii) in Systems, Networks, and Telecommunication Devices from [the Bonch-Bruevich Saint Petersburg State University of Telecommunications](https://www.sut.ru/) in Russia in 2018 with my supervisor - [Assos. Prof. Ol'ga Simonina](https://www.sut.ru/education/fakulteti-i-instituti/rts/rsiv/753-simonina-olga-aleksandrovna-2) (She has been a monumental influence in my life, serving as a close friend, an exceptional mentor, and a steadfast support throughout the challenging years of my PhD journey).

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Québec, Canada](https://www.uqtr.ca/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Thang Le-Dinh](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=1220) and [Prof. Sylvestre Uwizeyemungu](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=3307) focusing on cybersecurity analytics.

My research interests include network security, malware analysis, malware detection and classification, and applying AI/ML for cybersecurity. I lead the [NETSEC-ITDUT](https://netsec-it.dut.udn.vn/home) research group at my university in Vietnam, which focuses on networking, network security, and applying AI/ML to cybersecurity problems.

I have published several journal articles and conference papers on malware spreading models, intrusion detection systems, denial-of-service attack detection, and quality of service in wireless networks. I have received awards for my research, including an Outstanding Paper Award at ICACT2020 and ICACNGC2022.

I teach computer networks, network administration, malware analysis, network security, and network penetration testing courses at my university in Vietnam. I aim to conduct impactful research on pressing cybersecurity issues and prepare the next generation of computer networking and security professionals.
