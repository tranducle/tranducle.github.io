**Teaching Statement in Brief**  

My educational philosophy centres on maximizing student potential through three main actions - recommending suitable reference materials, encouraging student motivation and effort, and adapting my teaching methods to different learners.  

I believe finding the right reference materials or "textbooks" for each student is crucial for effective learning. I introduce students to a variety of relevant textbooks and allow them to choose which one aligns best with their needs and learning style. I learned this through experience - after some students struggled with an advanced textbook, I offered alternatives more suited to their level, leading to improved performance.  

In addition, I aim to motivate students by fostering a passion for the subject material. I share relatable anecdotes from my own student life to inspire self-belief and effort. Internal drive and self-motivation are critical for proactive learning.  

Furthermore, I respect student diversity and aim to create an open classroom environment that encourages academic freedom, debate, and critical thinking. My teaching methods remain flexible to adapt to different learners' needs.   

I view teaching as a mission, not just a job. Student feedback helps me continuously improve as an educator to meet each class' needs better. My ultimate goal is to ignite student passion for learning to drive their self-motivation and help them reach their full potential.
